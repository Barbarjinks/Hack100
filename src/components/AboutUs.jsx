At Eventifind, we're all about social inclusion. 
<br /><br />
We're on a mission to change the world and make it easier for everyone to access and attend local events. 
<br /><br />
Our service collates details of local events happening in your area, based on your preferences, and every week we'll send you a text message with details of events we think you'd be interested in. 
<br /><br />
If you see an event you're interested in, just reply to the text message, quoting the name of the event, and we'll put you in touch with a contact at the event that will contact you in advance to make sure that everything is in place to make your visit comfortable and enjoyable.
